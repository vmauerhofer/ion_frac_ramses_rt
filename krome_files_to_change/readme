Hello,

To install Krome on your computer, do
git clone https://bitbucket.org/tgrassi/krome.git
where you want the krome repository to be.

Replace the files ......./krome/src/krome.f90 and ......./krome/src/krome_subs.f90 by the files that are here.
This is because I modified the krome_equilibrium routine in krome.f90, and I added a routine to set directly the
photoionization rates without using an SED, in krome_subs.f90
